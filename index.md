# Welcome

Hi, and welcome to **stojchevski.com**.

This site is a **technical build log and portfolio** documenting my work in **embedded systems, PCB design, and hardware development**.  

The focus is on **how things are designed**, the **constraints involved**, and the **trade-offs made along the way** — not just final results.


::contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}


## What you’ll find here

- Detailed write-ups of **hardware design projects**
- PCB schematics, layout decisions, and manufacturing considerations
- Firmware–hardware interaction (QMK, embedded MCUs, USB, power)
- Lessons learned from real-world debugging and iteration
- Open-source projects with reproducible results

Most posts are written as **engineering case studies**, intended to be useful both for myself and for others working with similar constraints.

## Why this site exists

I use this site to:
- document projects end-to-end
- reflect on design decisions and mistakes
- build a long-term technical record of my work

If you’re reviewing this as part of a job application, this site is meant to show **how I think as an engineer**, not just what I’ve built.

## About me

I work primarily with:
- Embedded systems and microcontrollers
- Custom PCB design (schematic → layout → bring-up)
- USB, power delivery, and signal integrity considerations
- Mechanical keyboards and human–interface hardware

Everything [here](/blog) is hands-on and built from scratch.
