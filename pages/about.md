My name is Sinisha *(tip: friends call me Six)* and I am a software developer confident in writing robust, clean and easy maintainable code. Currently situated in beautiful Gothenburg, Sweden.

I'm a young *entrepreneur* and *founder* of [CTRL][ctrl], a company that offers web solutions for **affordable** prices because in today's modern world everybody deserves to be seen and heard on the internet. Before starting the company I have worked as an *IT technician and support* at [Community Development Institute][cdi], an organisation that aims to reduce diverses and prejudices in today's modern society. My experience also counts *12 sucessfully completed projects* in different programming languages with different purposes and goals. 

I am a big enthusiast in the **free and open source software** philosophy and active *Linux* user since 2008. I often encourage people to use and develop free software because it is the community that matters.
