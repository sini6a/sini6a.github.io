My name is Sinisha and I am a software developer confident in writing robust, clean and easy maintainable code. Currently situated in beautiful Gothenburg, Sweden.

I'm a young *entrepreneur* and *founder* of [CTRL][ctrl], a small company that offers web solutions for **affordable** prices because in today's modern world everybody deserves to be seen and heard on the internet. In my career I have been working as an *IT technician and support* at [Community Development Institute][cdi], a community that aims to reduce diverses and prejudices in today's modern society where I learned how to be calm under pressure faced with tight deadlines. My portfolio includes *many completed projects* in different programming languages and purposes starting from *web* and *mobile* all the way to standalone *desktop* applications. 

I am a big enthusiast in the **free and open source software** philosophy and active *GNU/Linux* user since 2008. I often encourage people in my circle to learn how to use and develop free software because it is the community that matters the most.
