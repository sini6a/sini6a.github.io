# What is this blog about?

This is my personal blog where every thought worth sharing eventually will be. My everyday job involves configuration and maintenance of Linux servers, installation of different content management systems (mostly [WordPress](https://wordpress.org)) and every random obstacles faced througout the day will be shared here as a reference for future uses. 

I also moved in Sweden couple of months ago (October 2019 to be specific) and I am planning on sharing some toughts of living here also, so expect mixed content.

## Who is it for?

Everybody. You can filter posts by tags specific for what you want to read. My writing skills are not at professional level but I hope that everything written will be well understood.

## What are my interests?

My greatest interest is Linux operating system and everything related to open-source and free software philosophy. I use Linux as a daily driver (Void Linux to be specific) and there will be many articles related to it.

## What are my hobbies?

I like spending my free time watching movies and TV series when at home and for the weekends I usually enjoy hanging out with friends at a bar or a cafe and full time learning Swedish at the moment.

### Lastly ...

I hope that you are going to enjoy the content and **do not** hesitate to contact me through social networks or by [e-mailing me](mailto:me@sini6a.info).

Have a good day/night!
