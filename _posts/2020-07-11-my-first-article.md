This is my personal blog where every thought worth sharing eventually will be. My everyday job involves configuration and maintenance of Linux servers, installation of different content management systems (mostly [WordPress](https://wordpress.org)) and every random obstacles faced througout the day will be shared here as a reference for future uses. 

I also moved in Sweden couple of months ago (October 2019 to be specific) and I am planning on sharing some toughts of living here also, so expect mixed content.

## Who is it for?

Everybody. You can filter posts by tags specific for what you want to read. My writing skills are not at professional level but I hope that everything written will be well understood.

## What are my interests?

My greatest interest is Linux operating system and everything related to open-source and free software philosophy. I use Linux as a daily driver (Void Linux to be specific) and there will be many articles related to it.

## What are my hobbies?

I like spending my free time watching movies and TV series when at home and for the weekends I usually enjoy hanging out with friends at a bar or a cafe and full time learning Swedish at the moment.

### Lastly ...

I hope that you are going to enjoy the content and **do not** hesitate to contact me through social networks or by [e-mailing me](mailto:me@sini6a.info).

Have a good day/night!
