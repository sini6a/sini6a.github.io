# TOX - Secure Instant Messaging!

If you read my blog then you already know that my focus is mostly privacy, free and open source software and programming but if you haven't read anything yet - I highly recommend that you do by starting with [What is GNU/Linux and FOSS]({{site.url}}/2020/what-is-foss-and-gnu-linux/). This time with great excitement... I introduce you... **TOX!**

## What is *TOX*?

*TOX* is a protocol for Instant Messaging with focus on privacy and security! It uses [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) architecture which means that there are no servers for storing your conversations and your data is not owned by anyone but **YOU!**

![WOW MEME!](https://i.imgflip.com/1cklgb.jpg)

Read more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tox_%28protocol%29).

## Why should you use *TOX* for IM?

[Mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance) is not something new for most of us and *Tox* is created while keeping that in mind and if you find yourself as one of many concerned then you can at least give it a try because except for being privacy oriented it also have some advanced features such as:

- Free & encrypted voice calls
- Secure video calls
- Screen sharing
- File sharing
- Groups
- last but not least: it's open source!

## Disadvantages using the *TOX*? 

Because *TOX* uses **peer-to-peer** architecture both parties must be online in order for them to exchange messages. This is how the architecture is designed and there are no workarounds available and probably never will be. 

## Okay... still interested?

*TOX* is just a protocol for making the communication and client needs to be installed in order to use it. Few of them I have personally tried and my top recommendation is [*qTox*](https://qtox.github.io/). It is written in *QT* framework, it offers few languages to choose from and it's cross-compatible which means that it can be installed on *Linux*, *Windows* and *macOS*. There is also client available for *Android* called *[Antox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chat.tox.antox&hl=en_US&gl=US)* which I haven't personally tested yet. 

There is a comprehensive [wiki](https://wiki.tox.chat/clients) available which lists client availability and features supported.

### Final thoughts 

I highly encourage everyone to use open-source software and I especially recommend *TOX* even for those who don't know anything about free and open-source! I used it quite a lot lately to exchange messages with my friends and family and so far I think it's not even comparable with some of the proprietary software available out there.

Check out more on their [website](https://tox.chat/) and please **be kind** and **spread the word!**

Have a good day/night!
