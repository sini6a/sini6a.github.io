# Summer in Sweden

Pictures

## Kvibergs park

PICTURE OF KVIBERG
This place is located near the center of the Gothenburg city in Sweden. There is one famous place nearby where people used to buy stuff but unfortunately it's closed now due to corona virus. I was walking by Kvibergs park where people play Kriket and spend their free weekends layed out on the empty premises of the green area. There are few big green terrains where people enjoy the sun all day long. My final destination was Bergsjonbadet where I did not expected to see much but... 

## Bergsojbadet

PICTURE OF BERGSJON
*Sjo* means sea in English and there are quite few in the area of Gothenburg. Swedes don't want to miss those opportunities because sometimes can be quite rainy here and there were many people taking this sunny opportunity to take a bath in the Bergsjobadet. I regreted not having my swimming shorts with me at the moment :(.

## Route

PICTURE OF THE ROUTE
I didn't expected walking for 8 km but there were few stops that I did in order to take a few pictures and take a rest.

### Final toughts

I really enjoyed the walk and I hope that there are going to be more opportunities to show you around Gothenburg, Sweden and maybe even further.

### Swedish language phrases:

I am quite new in Sweden and I have tought time finding friends and people to hang out so I have more time to enjoy with myself.

The funny fact is that you can only by alcohol in the shops so-called *Systembologet* and you must be older then 21. Another funny fact is that they are almost always requiring my ID even if I look older then that but I totally agree with that.
