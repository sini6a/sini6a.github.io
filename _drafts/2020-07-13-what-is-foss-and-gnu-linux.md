# What is FOSS?

FOSS stands for **Free and Open Source Software**.

FOSS is a software disturbed under licence that allows developers to *use, copy, study, and change* the software in any way they want. Developers can contribute by improving parts of the code thus fixing bugs, improving security or writing software features and the most important part of that long list is **no malware** because FOSS is built by community and every peace of code is publicly available. 

More on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

## Why should regular users care?

Because of the privacy, security and possibilities to modify the software to suit your needs, improve your productivity or workflow and because **you have** control over your computer and your data.

There are many of us who consider privacy a fundimental human right and we do not like someone using our data for profit without even letting us know!

Read more here and here.   

## Why should developers care?

Well... they should!

Because almost every embedded device out there is already using the *Linux* kernel which is in fact free and open-source. You can modify every part of it or add device functionalities and features. Imagine the unlimited possibilities, for example creating your own router with enhanced security and latest kernel, creating your own device driver or even whole operating system!

Plus, contribution to open source software **is like donating to charities!** :heart:

You contribute to community and you are part of that community. We are here to help and even guide you through your journey in the open source world.

# What is GNU/Linux?

Linux is a part of an operating system, to be specific the kernel of GNU/Linux is called Linux. There are hardware specific drivers and instructions written in the Linux kernel whereas GNU is the set of applications that are used in userspace.

DISCLAIMER: Linux is registered trademark of Linus Torvalds.

## Interested?

Great! I hope that you will have fun learning because you will learn a lot. I would suggest starting by installing or trying a *Linux* distribution that is more begginer friendly and one that you are going to be comfortable with.

At first using the terminal will probably be difficult and inconvenient but trust me in the future you are going to love it! I will give you few tips and recommendations on getting started and the best part is that you can try every Linux distribution without making **any** modification to the computer's file systems!

Cool, right? 

### Begginer friendly Linux distros

This is my personal list of beginner friendly distros and it is not limited or final in any way. Currently there are ~900 *Linux* distributions till date (2020-07-13) and my personal list upvotes those who have good community support and are stable enough for everyday regular use:

- Debian
- ElementaryOS
- Fedora

## Not interested?

It is up to you to decide how are you going to use your computer and you have every right to choose your software. My goal is sharing the alternative that I didn't knew existed back when I started learning about computers and technology in general.

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed!

Have a good day/night.
